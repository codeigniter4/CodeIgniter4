# CodeIgniter 4 Application Starter

## What is CodeIgniter?
CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible, and secure. 
More information can be found at the [official site](http://codeigniter.com).

This repository holds a composer-installable app starter.
It has been built from the 
[development repository](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4).

**This is pre-release code and should not be used in production sites.**

--- 
 
**CAUTION: This app starter is EXPERIMENTAL, and likely to change before
the framework release. We are looking for feedback and suggestions!**

More information about the plans for version 4 can be found in [the announcement](http://forum.codeigniter.com/thread-62615.html) on the forums.

The user guide corresponding to this version of the framework can be found
[here](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/). 

##Installation & updates

`composer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter` then `composer update` whenever
there is a new release of the framework.

##Setup

Copy `env` to `.env` and tailor for your app, specifically the baseURL
and any database settings.

## Important Change with index.php

`index.php` is no longer in the root of the project! It has been moved inside the *public* folder,
for better security and separation of components.

This means that you should configure your web server to "point" to your project's *public* folder, and
not to the project root. A better practice would be to configure a virtual host to point there. A poor practice would be to point your web server to the project root and expect to enter *public/...*, as the rest of your logic and the
framework are exposed.

**Please** read the user guide for a better explanation of how CI4 works!
The user guide updating and deployment is a bit awkward at the moment, but we are working on it!

## Server Requirements
