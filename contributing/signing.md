# Contribution Signing

We ask that contributions have code commits signed. **This is important
in order to prove, as best we can, the provenance of contributions.**

The developer pushing a commit as part of a PR isn't necessarily the
person who committed it originally, if the commit is not signed. This
distorts the commit history and makes it hard to tell where code came
from.

If a person "signs off" a commit, they are free to use any name,
specifically one not their own. Again, the commit history cannot be
relied on to determine the origin of the code, if one developer is
spoofing another. A malicious person could commit bad code (for instance
a virus) and make it look like another developer created it.

The best solution, while not fool-proof, is to "securely sign" your
commits. Such commits are digitally signed, with a GPG-key associated
with your GitHub account. It still isn't foolproof, because a malicious
developer could create a bogus email and account, but it is more
reliable than an unsigned or a "signed-off by" commit.

If you don't sign your commits, we **may** accept your contribution,
assuming it meets usefulness and contribution guidelines, but only if it
isn't critical code and only after checking it carefully. If code
performs an important role, we will insist that it be securely signed.

Read below to find out how to sign your commits :)

## Secure Signing

To verify your commits, you will need to setup a GPG key, and attach it
to your GitHub account.

See the [git tools](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work) page
for directions on doing this. The complete story is part of [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/categories/gpg/).

The basic steps are

- [generate your GPG key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-gpg-key/),
    and copy the ASCII representation of it.
- [Add your GPG key to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account/).
- [Tell Git](https://help.github.com/articles/telling-git-about-your-gpg-key/)
    about your GPG key.
- [Set default signing](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-using-gpg/)
    to have all of your commits securely signed automatically.
- Provide your GPG key passphrase, as prompted, when you do a commit.

Depending on your IDE, you may have to do your Git commits from your Git
bash shell to use the **-S** option to force the secure signing.

## Commit Messages

Regardless of how you sign a commit, commit messages are important too.
They communicate the intent of a specific change, concisely. They make
it easier to review code, and to find out why a change was made if the
code history is examined later.

The audience for your commit messages will be the codebase maintainers,
any code reviewers, and debuggers trying to figure out when a bug might
have been introduced.

Make your commit messages meaningful.
