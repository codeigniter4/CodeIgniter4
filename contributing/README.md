# Contributing to CodeIgniter

CodeIgniter is a community driven project and accepts contributions of
code and documentation from the community. These contributions are made
in the form of Issues or [Pull
Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) on the
[CodeIgniter4 repository](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4)
on GitHub.

We will try to manage the process somewhat, by adding a ["help wanted" label](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/labels/help%20wanted) to those that we are
specifically interested in at any point in time. Join the discussion for those issues and let us know
if you want to take the lead on one of them.
