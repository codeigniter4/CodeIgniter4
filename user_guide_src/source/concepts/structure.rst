Application Structure
#####################

To get the most out of CodeIgniter, you need to understand how the application is structured, by default, and what you
can change to meet the needs of your application.

.. contents::
    :local:
    :depth: 2

Default Directories
*******************

A fresh install has five directories: ``app/``, ``public/``,
``writable/``, ``tests/`` and ``vendor/`` or ``system/``.
Each of these directories has a very specific part to play.

app
===

The ``app`` directory is where all of your application code lives. This comes with a default directory
structure that works well for many applications. The following folders make up the basic contents:

.. code-block:: none

    app/
        Config/         Stores the configuration files
        Controllers/    Controllers determine the program flow
        Database/       Stores the database migrations and seeds files
        Filters/        Stores filter classes that can run before and after controller
        Helpers/        Helpers store collections of standalone functions
        Language/       Multiple language support reads the language strings from here
        Libraries/      Useful classes that don't fit in another category
        Models/         Models work with the database to represent the business entities
        ThirdParty/     ThirdParty libraries that can be used in application
        Views/          Views make up the HTML that is displayed to the client

Because the ``app`` directory is already namespaced, you should feel free to modify the structure
of this directory to suit your application's needs. For example, you might decide to start using the Repository
pattern and Entity Models to work with your data. In this case, you could rename the ``Models`` directory to
``Repositories``, and add a new ``Entities`` directory.

.. note:: If you rename the ``Controllers`` directory, though, you will not be able to use the automatic method of
        routing to controllers, and will need to define all of your routes in the routes file.

All files in this directory live under the ``App`` namespace, though you are free to change that in
**app/Config/Constants.php**.

system
======

.. note:: If you install CodeIgniter with Composer, the ``system`` is located in ``vendor/codeigniter4/framework/system``.

This directory stores the files that make up the framework, itself. While you have a lot of flexibility in how you
use the application directory, the files in the system directory should never be modified. Instead, you should
extend the classes, or create new classes, to provide the desired functionality.

All files in this directory live under the ``CodeIgniter`` namespace.

.. _application-structure-public:

public
======

The **public** folder holds the browser-accessible portion of your web application,
preventing direct access to your source code.
It contains the main **.htaccess** file, **index.php**, and any application
assets that you add, like CSS, javascript, or
images.

This folder is meant to be the "web root" of your site, and your web server
would be configured to point to it.

writable
========

This directory holds any directories that might need to be written to in the course of an application's life.
This includes directories for storing cache files, logs, and any uploads a user might send. You should add any other
directories that your application will need to write to here. This allows you to keep your other primary directories
non-writable as an added security measure.

tests
=====

This directory is set up to hold your test files. The ``_support`` directory holds various mock classes and other
utilities that you can use while writing your tests. This directory does not need to be transferred to your
production servers.

Modifying Directory Locations
*****************************

If you've relocated any of the main directories, you can change the configuration
settings inside **app/Config/Paths.php**.

Please read :doc:`Managing your Applications <../general/managing_apps>`.
