Loading this Helper
===================

This helper is loaded using the following code::

    helper('date');

Available Functions
===================

The following functions are available:

.. php:function:: now([$timezone = null])

    :param    string    $timezone: Timezone
    :returns:    UNIX timestamp
    :rtype:    int

    Returns the current time as a UNIX timestamp, referenced either to your server's
    local time or any PHP supported timezone, based on the "time reference" setting
    in your config file. If you do not intend to set your master time reference to
    any other PHP supported timezone (which you'll typically do if you run a site
    that lets each user set their own timezone settings) there is no benefit to using
    this function over PHP's ``time()`` function.
    ::

        echo now('Australia/Victoria');

    If a timezone is not provided, it will return ``time()`` based on the
    **time_reference** setting.

.. php:function:: timezone_select([$class = '', $default = '', $what = \DateTimeZone::ALL, $country = null])

    :param    string    $class: Optional class to apply to the select field
    :param    string    $default: Default value for initial selection
    :param    int    $what: DateTimeZone class constants (see `listIdentifiers <https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetimezone.listidentifiers.php>`_)
    :param    string    $country: A two-letter ISO 3166-1 compatible country code (see `listIdentifiers <https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetimezone.listidentifiers.php>`_)
    :returns:    Preformatted HTML select field
    :rtype:    string

    Generates a `select` form field of available timezones (optionally filtered by `$what` and `$country`).
    You can supply an option class to apply to the field to make formatting easier, as well as a default
    selected value.
    ::

        echo timezone_select('custom-select', 'America/New_York');

Many functions previously found in the CodeIgniter 3 ``date_helper`` have been moved to the ``I18n``
module in CodeIgniter 4.
