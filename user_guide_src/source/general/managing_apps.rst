Managing your Applications
##########################

By default, it is assumed that you only intend to use CodeIgniter to
manage one application, which you will build in your **application**
directory. It is possible, however, to have multiple sets of
applications that share a single CodeIgniter installation, or even to
rename or relocate your application directory.

Renaming or Relocating the Application Directory
================================================

If you would like to rename your application directory or even move
it to a different location on your server, other than your project root, open
your main **app/Config/Paths.php** and set a *full server path* in the
``$appDirectory`` variable (at about line 45)::

    public $appDirectory = '/path/to/your/application';

You will need to modify two additional files in your project root, so that
they can find the ``Paths`` configuration file:

- ``/spark`` runs command line apps; the path is specified on or about line 36::

    $pathsConfig = 'app/Config/Paths.php';
    // ^^^ Change this line if you move your application folder


- ``/public/index.php`` is the front controller for your webapp; the config
  path is specified on or about line 20::

    $pathsConfig = FCPATH . '../app/Config/Paths.php';
    // ^^^ Change this if you move your application folder


Running Multiple Applications with one CodeIgniter Installation
===============================================================

If you would like to share a common CodeIgniter framework installation, to manage
several different applications, simply put all of the directories located
inside your application directory into their own (sub)-directory.

For example, let's say you want to create two applications, named "foo"
and "bar". You could structure your application project directories like this:

.. code-block:: text

    /foo
        /app
        /public
        /tests
        /writable
    /bar
        /app
        /public
        /tests
        /writable
    /codeigniter
        /system
        /docs

This would have two apps, "foo" and "bar", both having standard application directories
and a ``public`` folder, and sharing a common codeigniter framework.

The ``index.php`` inside each application would refer to its own configuration,
``../app/Config/Paths.php``, and the ``$systemDirectory`` variable inside each
of those would be set to refer to the shared common "system" folder.

If either of the applications had a command-line component, then you would also
modify ``spark`` inside each application's project folder, as directed above.
