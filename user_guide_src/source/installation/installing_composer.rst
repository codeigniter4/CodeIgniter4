Composer Installation

Composer can be used in several ways to install CodeIgniter4 on your system.

The first two techniques describe creating a skeleton project
using CodeIgniter4, that you would then use as the base for a new webapp.
The third technique described below lets you add CodeIgniter4 to an existing
webapp,

.. note:: If you are using a Git repository to store your code, or for
   collaboration with others, then the ``vendor`` folder would normally
   be "git ignored". In such a case, you will need to do a ``composer update``
   when you clone the repository to a new system.

App Starter
===========

The `CodeIgniter 4 app starter <https://github.com/codeigniter4/appstarter>`_
repository holds a skeleton application, with a composer dependency on
the latest released version of the framework.

This installation technique would suit a developer who wishes to start
a new CodeIgniter4 based project.

Installation & Set Up
---------------------

In the folder above your project root::

    > composer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter project-root

The command above will create a "project-root" folder.

If you omit the "project-root" argument, the command will create an
"appstarter" folder, which can be renamed as appropriate.

If you don't need or want phpunit installed, and all of its composer
dependencies, then add the ``--no-dev`` option to the end of the above
command line. That will result in only the framework, and the three
trusted dependencies that we bundle, being composer-installed.

A sample such installation command, using the default project-root "appstarter"::

    > composer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter --no-dev

After installation you should follow the steps in the "Upgrading" section.

Upgrading
---------

Whenever there is a new release, then from the command line in your project root::

    > composer update

If you want to compare the latest framework source structure for non-system directory (app, public, etc), you can update with ``--prefer-source``::

    > composer update codeigniter4/framework --prefer-source

If ``--prefer-source`` doesn't automatically update to pull latest framework source structure, you can remove first::

    rm -rf vendor/codeigniter4/framework && composer update codeigniter4/framework --prefer-source

If you used the ``--no-dev`` option when you created the project, it
would be appropriate to do so here too, i.e., ``composer update --no-dev``.

Read the upgrade instructions, and check designated  ``app/Config`` folders for affected changes.

Pros
----

Simple installation; easy to update

Cons
----

You still need to check for ``app/Config`` changes after updating

Structure
---------

Folders in your project after set up:

- app, public, tests, writable
- vendor/codeigniter4/framework/system
- vendor/codeigniter4/framework/app & public (compare with yours after updating when using ``--prefer-source``)

Latest Dev
----------

The App Starter repo comes with a ``builds`` scripts to switch Composer sources between the
current stable release and the latest development branch of the framework. Use this script
for a developer who is willing to live with the latest unreleased changes, which may be unstable.

The `development user guide <https://codeigniter4.github.io/CodeIgniter4/>`_ is accessible online.
Note that this differs from the released user guide, and will pertain to the
develop branch explicitly.

In your project root::

    php builds development

The command above will update **composer.json** to point to the ``develop`` branch of the
working repository, and update the corresponding paths in config and XML files. To revert
these changes run::

    php builds release

After using the ``builds`` command be sure to run ``composer update`` to sync your vendor
folder with the latest target build.

Adding CodeIgniter4 to an Existing Project
==========================================

The same `CodeIgniter 4 framework <https://github.com/codeigniter4/framework>`_
repository described in "Manual Installation" can also be added to an
existing project using Composer.

Develop your app inside the ``app`` folder, and the ``public`` folder
will be your document root.

In your project root::

    > composer require codeigniter4/framework --prefer-source

As with the earlier two composer install methods, you can omit installing
phpunit and its dependencies by adding the ``--no-dev`` argument to the ``composer require`` command.

Set Up
------

Copy the ``app``, ``public``, and ``writable`` folders from ``vendor/codeigniter4/framework``
to your project root

Copy the ``env``, ``phpunit.xml.dist`` and ``spark`` files, from
``vendor/codeigniter4/framework`` to your project root

You will have to adjust the system path to refer to the vendor one, e.g., ``ROOTPATH . '/vendor/codeigniter4/framework/system'``,
- the ``$systemDirectory`` variable in **app/Config/Paths.php**

Upgrading
---------

Whenever there is a new release, then from the command line in your project root::

    > composer update --prefer-source

Read the upgrade instructions, and check designated
``app/Config`` folders for affected changes.

Pros
----

Relatively simple installation; easy to update

Cons
----

You still need to check for ``app/Config`` changes after updating

Structure
---------

Folders in your project after set up:

- app, public, writable (when using ``--prefer-source``)
- vendor/codeigniter4/framework/system


Translations Installation
=========================

If you want to take advantage of the system message translations,
they can be added to your project in a similar fashion.

From the command line inside your project root::

    > composer require codeigniter4/translations

These will be updated along with the framework whenever you do a ``composer update``.
