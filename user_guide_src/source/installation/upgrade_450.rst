Mandatory File Changes
**********************

index.php and spark
===================

The following files received significant changes and
**you must merge the updated versions** with your application:

- ``public/index.php``
- ``spark``

.. important:: If you don't update the above files, CodeIgniter will not work
    properly after running ``composer update``.

    The upgrade procedure, for example, is as follows:

    .. code-block:: console

        composer update
        cp vendor/codeigniter4/framework/public/index.php public/index.php
        cp vendor/codeigniter4/framework/spark spark

Breaking Changes
****************

.. _upgrade-450-lowercase-http-method-name:

Lowercase HTTP Method Name
==========================

Request::getMethod()
--------------------

For historical reasons, ``Request::getMethod()`` returned HTTP method names in
lower case by default.

But the method token is case-sensitive because it might be used as a gateway
to object-based systems with case-sensitive method names. By convention,
standardized methods are defined in all-uppercase US-ASCII letters.
See https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#name-overview.

Now the deprecated ``$upper`` parameter in ``Request::getMethod()`` has been
removed, and the ``getMethod()`` returns the as-is HTTP method name. That is,
uppercase like "GET", "POST", and so on.

If you want lowercase HTTP method names, use PHP's ``strtolower()`` function::

    strtolower($request->getMethod())

And you should use uppercase HTTP method names in your app code.

app/Config/Filters.php
----------------------

You should update the keys to uppercase in ``$methods`` in **app/Config/Filters.php**::

    public array $methods = [
        'POST' => ['invalidchars', 'csrf'],
        'GET'  => ['csrf'],
    ];

CURLRequest::request()
----------------------

In previous versions, you could pass lowercase HTTP methods to the ``request()``
method. But this bug has been fixed.

Now you must pass the correct HTTP method names like ``GET``, ``POST``. Otherwise
you would get the error response::

    $client   = \Config\Services::curlrequest();
    $response = $client->request('get', 'https://www.google.com/', [
        'http_errors' => false,
    ]);
    $response->getStatusCode(); // In previous versions: 200
                                //     In this verrsion: 405

.. _upgrade-450-nested-route-groups-and-options:

Nested Route Groups and Options
===============================

A bug that prevented options passed to outer ``group()`` from being merged with
options in inner ``group()`` has been fixed.

Check and correct your route configuration as it could change the values of the
options applied.

For example,

.. code-block:: php

    $routes->group('admin', ['filter' => 'csrf'], static function ($routes) {
        $routes->get('/', static function () {
            // ...
        });

        $routes->group('users', ['namespace' => 'Users'], static function ($routes) {
            $routes->get('/', static function () {
                // ...
            });
        });
    });

Now the ``csrf`` filter is executed for both the route ``admin`` and ``admin/users``.
In previous versions, it is executed only for the route ``admin``.
See also :ref:`routing-nesting-groups`.

.. _upgrade-450-filter-execution-order:

Filter Execution Order
======================

The order in which Controller Filters are executed has changed.
If you wish to maintain the same execution order as in previous versions, set
``true`` to ``Config\Feature::$oldFilterOrder``. See also :ref:`filter-execution-order`.

1. The order of execution of filter groups has been changed.

    Before Filters::

        Previous: route → globals → methods → filters
             Now: globals → methods → filters → route

    After Filters::

        Previous: route → globals → filters
             Now: route → filters → globals

2. The After Filters in *Route* filters and *Filters* filters execution order is now
reversed.

    When you have the following configuration:

    .. code-block:: php

        // In app/Config/Routes.php
        $routes->get('/', 'Home::index', ['filter' => ['route1', 'route2']]);

        // In app/Config/Filters.php
        public array $filters = [
            'filter1' => ['before' => '*', 'after' => '*'],
            'filter2' => ['before' => '*', 'after' => '*'],
        ];

    Before Filters::

        Previous: route1 → route2 → filter1 → filter2
             Now: filter1 → filter2 → route1 → route2

    After Filters::

        Previous: route1 → route2 → filter1 → filter2
             Now: route2 → route1 → filter2 → filter1

.. _upgrade-450-api-response-trait:

API\\ResponseTrait and String Data
==================================

In previous versions, if you pass string data to a trait method, the framework
returned an HTML response, even if the response format was determined to be JSON.

Now if you pass string data, it returns a JSON response correctly. See also
:ref:`api-response-trait-handling-response-types`.

You can keep the behavior in previous versions if you set the ``$stringAsHtml``
property to ``true`` in your controller.

FileLocator::findQualifiedNameFromPath()
========================================

In previous versions, ``FileLocator::findQualifiedNameFromPath()`` returns Fully
Qualified Classnames with a leading ``\``. Now the leading ``\`` has been removed.

If you have code that expects a leading ``\``, fix it.

BaseModel::getIdValue()
=======================

The ``BaseModel::getIdValue()`` has been changed to ``abstract``, and the implementation
has been removed.

If you extneds ``BaseModel``, implement the ``getIdValue()`` method in the child class.

Factories
=========

:doc:`../concepts/factories` has been changed to a final class.
In the unlikely event, you have inherited the Factories, stop inheriting and
copy the code into your Factories class.

Auto Routing (Legacy)
=====================

In previous versions, the controller filters might be executed even when the
corresponding controller was not found.

This bug has been fixed and now a ``PageNotFoundException`` will be thrown and
the filters will not be executed if the controller is not found.

If you have code that depends on this bug, for example if you expect global filters
to be executed even for non-existent pages, please add the necessary routes.

Method Signature Changes
========================

Some method signature changes have been made. Classes that extend them should
update their APIs to reflect the changes. See :ref:`ChangeLog <v450-method-signature-changes>`
for details.

Removed Deprecated Items
========================

Some deprecated items have been removed. If you extend these classes and are
using them, upgrade your code. See :ref:`ChangeLog <v450-removed-deprecated-items>` for details.

Breaking Enhancements
*********************

.. _upgrade-450-404-override:

404 Override Status Code
========================

In previous versions, :ref:`404-override` returned responses with the status code
``200`` by default. Now it returns ``404`` by default.

If you want ``200``, you need to set it in the controller::

    $routes->set404Override(static function () {
        response()->setStatusCode(200);

        echo view('my_errors/not_found.html');
    });

Validation::run() Signature
===========================

The method signatures of ``Validation::run()`` and ``ValidationInterface::run()``
have been changed. The ``?string`` typehint on the ``$dbGroup`` parameter was
removed. Extending classes should likewise remove the parameter so as not to
break LSP.

Project Files
*************

Some files in the **project space** (root, app, public, writable) received updates. Due to
these files being outside of the **system** scope they will not be changed without your intervention.

There are some third-party CodeIgniter modules available to assist with merging changes to
the project space: `Explore on Packagist <https://packagist.org/explore/?query=codeigniter4%20updates>`_.

Content Changes
===============

The following files received significant changes (including deprecations or visual adjustments)
and it is recommended that you merge the updated versions with your application:

Config
------

app/Config/Filters.php
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Required Filters have been added, so the following changes were made. See also
:ref:`Upgrading <v450-required-filters>`.

The base class has been changed::

    class Filters extends \CodeIgniter\Config\Filters

The following items are added in the ``$aliases`` property::

    public array $aliases = [
        // ...
        'forcehttps'    => \CodeIgniter\Filters\ForceHTTPS::class,
        'pagecache'     => \CodeIgniter\Filters\PageCache::class,
        'performance'   => \CodeIgniter\Filters\PerformanceMetrics::class,
    ];

A new property ``$required`` is added, and set as the following::

    public array $required = [
        'before' => [
            'forcehttps', // Force Global Secure Requests
            'pagecache',  // Web Page Caching
        ],
        'after' => [
            'pagecache',   // Web Page Caching
            'performance', // Performance Metrics
            'toolbar',     // Debug Toolbar
        ],
    ];

The  ``'toolbar'`` in the ``$global['after']`` was removed.

Others
^^^^^^

- app/Config/Boot/production.php
    - The default error level to ``error_reporting()`` has been changed to ``E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED``.
- app/Config/Database.php
    - The default value of ``charset`` in ``$default`` has been change to ``utf8mb4``.
    - The default value of ``DBCollat`` in ``$default`` has been change to ``utf8mb4_general_ci``.
    - The default value of ``DBCollat`` in ``$tests`` has been change to ``''``.
- app/Config/Feature.php
    - ``Config\Feature::$limitZeroAsAll`` has been added. See
      :ref:`v450-query-builder-limit-0-behavior`.
    - ``Config\Feature::$multipleFilters`` has been removed, because now
      :ref:`multiple-filters` are always enabled.
- app/Config/Kint.php
    - It no longer extends ``BaseConfig`` because enabling
      :ref:`factories-config-caching` could cause errors.

All Changes
===========

This is a list of all files in the **project space** that received changes;
many will be simple comments or formatting that have no effect on the runtime:
