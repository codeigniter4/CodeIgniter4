Documentations
==============

- `Controller Documentation CodeIgniter 3.X <http://codeigniter.com/userguide3/general/controllers.html>`_
- :doc:`Controller Documentation CodeIgniter 4.X </incoming/controllers>`

What has been changed
=====================

- Since namespaces have been added to CodeIgniter 4, the controllers must be changed to support namespaces.
- Controllers don’t use constructors any more (to invoke CI “magic”) unless those are part of base controllers you make.
- CI provides Request and Response objects for you to work with - more powerful than the CI3-way.
- If you want a base controller (``MY_Controller`` in CI3), make it where you like, 
  e.g., BaseController extends Controller, and then have your controllers extend it

Upgrade Guide
=============

1. First, move all controller files to the folder **app/Controllers**.
2. Add this line just after the opening php tag: ``namespace App\Controllers;``
3. Replace ``extends CI_Controller`` with ``extends BaseController``.

| If you use sub-directories in your controller structure, you have to change the namespace according to that.
| For example, you have a version 3 controller located in **application/controllers/users/auth/Register.php**,
    the namespace has to be ``namespace App\Controllers\Users\Auth;`` and the controller path in the version 4 
    should look like this: **app/Controllers/Users/Auth/Register.php**. Make sure to have the first letters of
    the sub-directories as capitalized.
| After that you have to insert a ``use`` statement below the namespace definition in order to extend the ``BaseController``:
    ``use App\Controllers\BaseController;``

Code Example
============

CodeIgniter Version 3.11
------------------------

Path: **application/controllers**::

    <?php

    class Helloworld extends CI_Controller
    {
        public function index($name)
        {
            echo "Hello $name! ";
        }
    }

CodeIgniter Version 4.x
-----------------------

Path: **app/Controllers**::

    <?php

    namespace App\Controllers;

    class Helloworld extends BaseController
    {
        public function index($name)
        {
            echo 'Hello ' . esc($name) . '!';
        }
    }
