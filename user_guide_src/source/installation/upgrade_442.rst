Project Files
*************

Some files in the **project space** (root, app, public, writable) received updates. Due to
these files being outside of the **system** scope they will not be changed without your intervention.

There are some third-party CodeIgniter modules available to assist with merging changes to
the project space: `Explore on Packagist <https://packagist.org/explore/?query=codeigniter4%20updates>`_.

All Changes
===========

This is a list of all files in the **project space** that received changes;
many will be simple comments or formatting that have no effect on the runtime:

- app/Config/Migrations.php
- app/Config/View.php
- composer.json
