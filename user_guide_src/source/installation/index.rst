Installation
############

CodeIgniter4 can be installed in a number of different ways: manually,
using `Composer <https://getcomposer.org>`_, or using
`Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_.
Which is right for you?

- If you would like the simple "download & go" install that CodeIgniter3
  is known for, choose the manual installation.
- If you plan to add third party packages to your project, or want to keep
  CodeIgniter up to date easily, we recommend the Composer installation.

However you choose to install and run CodeIgniter4, the
`user guide <https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/>`_ is accessible online.

.. note:: Before using CodeIgniter 4, make sure that your server meets the
    :doc:`requirements </intro/requirements>`, in particular the PHP
    version and the PHP extensions that are needed.
    You may find that you have to uncomment the ``php.ini`` "extension"
    lines to enable "curl" and "intl", for instance.
