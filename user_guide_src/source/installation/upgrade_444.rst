.. _upgrade-444-validation-with-dot-array-syntax:

Validation with Dot Array Syntax
================================

If you are using :ref:`dot array syntax <validation-dot-array-syntax>` in validation
rules, a bug where ``*`` would validate data in incorrect dimensions has been fixed.

In previous versions, the rule key ``contacts.*.name`` captured data with any
level like ``contacts.*.name``, ``contacts.*.*.name``, ``contacts.*.*.*.name``,
etc., incorrectly.

The following code explains details:

.. literalinclude:: upgrade_444/001.php
   :lines: 2-

If you have code that depends on the bug, fix the the rule key.

Validation rules matches and differs
====================================

Because bugs have been fixed in the case where ``matches`` and ``differs`` in
the Strict and Traditional rules validate data of non-string types, if you are
using these rules and validate non-string data, the validation results might be
changed (fixed).

Note that Traditional Rules should not be used to validate data that is not a
string.

these files being outside of the **system** scope they will not be changed without your intervention.

There are some third-party CodeIgniter modules available to assist with merging changes to
the project space: `Explore on Packagist <https://packagist.org/explore/?query=codeigniter4%20updates>`_.
