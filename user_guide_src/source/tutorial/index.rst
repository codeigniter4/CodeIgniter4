Overview
********

This tutorial is intended to introduce you to the CodeIgniter4 framework
and the basic principles of MVC architecture. It will show you how a
basic CodeIgniter application is constructed in a step-by-step fashion.

If you are not familiar with PHP, we recommend that you check out
the `W3Schools PHP Tutorial <https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp>`_ before continuing.

In this tutorial, you will be creating a **basic news application**. You
will begin by writing the code that can load static pages. Next, you
will create a news section that reads news items from a database.
Finally, you'll add a form to create news items in the database.

This tutorial will primarily focus on:

-  Model-View-Controller basics
-  Routing basics
-  Form validation
-  Performing basic database queries using CodeIgniter's Model

The entire tutorial is split up over several pages, each explaining a
small part of the functionality of the CodeIgniter framework. You'll go
through the following pages:

-  Introduction, this page, which gives you an overview of what to
   expect and gets your default application downloaded and running.
-  :doc:`Static pages <static_pages>`, which will teach you the basics
   of controllers, views and routing.
-  :doc:`News section <news_section>`, where you'll start using models
   and will be doing some basic database operations.
-  :doc:`Create news items <create_news_items>`, which will introduce
   more advanced database operations and form validation.
-  :doc:`Conclusion <conclusion>`, which will give you some pointers on
   further reading and other resources.

Enjoy your exploration of the CodeIgniter framework.

Getting Up and Running
**********************

Installing CodeIgniter
======================

You can download a release manually from the site, but for this tutorial we will
use the recommended way and install the AppStarter package through Composer.
From your command line type the following:

.. code-block:: console

    composer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter ci-news

This creates a new folder, **ci-news**, which contains your application code, with
CodeIgniter installed in the vendor folder.

.. _setting-development-mode:

Setting Development Mode
========================

By default, CodeIgniter starts up in production mode. This is a safety feature
to keep your site a bit more secure in case settings are messed up once it is live.
So first let's fix that. Copy or rename the **env** file to **.env**. Open it up.

This file contains server-specific settings. This means you never will need to
commit any sensitive information to your version control system. It includes
some of the most common ones you want to enter already, though they are all commented
out. So uncomment the line with ``CI_ENVIRONMENT`` on it, and change ``production`` to
``development``::

    CI_ENVIRONMENT = development

Running Development Server
==========================

With that out of the way it's time to view your application in a browser. You can
serve it through any server of your choice, Apache, nginx, etc, but CodeIgniter
comes with a simple command that takes advantage of PHP's built-in server to get
you up and running fast on your development machines. Type the following on the
command line from the root of your project:

.. code-block:: console

    php spark serve

The Welcome Page
****************

Now point your browser to the correct URL you will be greeted by a welcome screen.
Try it now by heading to the following URL::

    http://localhost:8080

and you should be greeted by the following page:

.. image:: ../images/welcome.png

This means that your application works and you can start making changes to it.

Debugging
*********

Debug Toolbar
=============

Now that you're in development mode, you'll see the CodeIgniter flame on the right bottom of your application. Click it and you'll see the debug toolbar.

This toolbar contains a number of helpful items that you can reference during development.
This will never show in production environments. Clicking any of the tabs along the bottom
brings up additional information. Clicking the X on the right of the toolbar minimizes it
to a small square with the CodeIgniter flame on it. If you click that the toolbar
will show again.

.. image:: ../images/debugbar.png

Error Pages
===========

In addition to this, CodeIgniter has some helpful error pages when you hit exceptions or
other errors in your program. Open up **app/Controllers/Home.php** and change some line
to generate an error (removing a semi-colon or brace should do the trick!). You will be
greeted by a screen looking something like this:

.. image:: ../images/error.png

There are a couple of things to note here:

1. Hovering over the red header at the top reveals a **search** link that will open up
   DuckDuckGo.com in a new tab and searching for the exception.
2. Clicking the **arguments** link on any line in the Backtrace will expand a list of
   the arguments that were passed into that function call.

Everything else should be clear when you see it.

Now that we know how to get started and how to debug a little, let's get started building this
small news application.
