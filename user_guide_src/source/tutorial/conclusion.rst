Conclusion
##########

This tutorial did not cover all of the things you might expect of a
full-fledged content management system, but it introduced you to the
more important topics of routing, writing controllers, and models. We
hope this tutorial gave you an insight into some of CodeIgniter's basic
design patterns, which you can expand upon.

Now that you've completed this tutorial, we recommend you check out the
rest of the documentation. CodeIgniter is often praised because of its
comprehensive documentation. Use this to your advantage and read the
"Overview" and "General Topics" sections thoroughly. You should read
the class and helper references when needed.

Every intermediate PHP programmer should be able to get the hang of
CodeIgniter within a few days.

If you still have questions about the framework or your own CodeIgniter
code, you can:
