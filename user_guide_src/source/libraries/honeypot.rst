=====================
Honeypot Class
=====================

The Honeypot Class makes it possible to determine when a Bot makes a request to a CodeIgniter4 application,
if it's enabled in ``Application\Config\Filters.php`` file. This is done by attaching form fields to any form,
and this form field is hidden from a human but accessible to a Bot. When data is entered into the field, it's
assumed the request is coming from a Bot, and you can throw a ``HoneypotException``.

Enabling Honeypot
=====================

To enable a Honeypot, changes have to be made to the **app/Config/Filters.php**. Just uncomment honeypot
from the ``$globals`` array, like:

.. literalinclude:: honeypot/001.php

A sample Honeypot filter is bundled, as ``system/Filters/Honeypot.php``.
If it is not suitable, make your own at ``app/Filters/Honeypot.php``,
and modify the ``$aliases`` in the configuration appropriately.

Customizing Honeypot
=====================

Honeypot can be customized. The fields below can be set either in
**app/Config/Honeypot.php** or in **.env**.

* ``hidden`` - true|false to control visibility of the honeypot field; default is ``true``
* ``label`` - HTML label for the honeypot field, default is 'Fill This Field'
* ``name`` - name of the HTML form field used for the template; default is 'honeypot'
* ``template`` - form field template used for the honeypot; default is '<label>{label}</label><input type="text" name="{name}" value=""/>'
