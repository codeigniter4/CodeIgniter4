The Security Class contains methods that help protect your site against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

*******************
Loading the Library
*******************

If your only interest in loading the library is to handle CSRF protection, then you will never need to load it,
as it runs as a filter and has no manual interaction.

If you find a case where you do need direct access though, you may load it through the Services file::

    $security = \Config\Services::security();

*********************************
Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
*********************************

You can enable CSRF protection by altering your **app/Config/Filters.php**
and enabling the `csrf` filter globally::

    public $globals = [
        'before' => [
            // 'honeypot',
            'csrf',
        ],
    ];

Select URIs can be whitelisted from CSRF protection (for example API
endpoints expecting externally POSTed content). You can add these URIs
by adding them as exceptions in the filter::

    public $globals = [
        'before' => [
            'csrf' => ['except' => ['api/record/save']],
        ],
    ];

Regular expressions are also supported (case-insensitive)::

    public $globals = [
        'before' => [
            'csrf' => ['except' => ['api/record/[0-9]+']],
        ],
    ];

If you use the :doc:`form helper <../helpers/form_helper>`, then
:func:`form_open()` will automatically insert a hidden csrf field in
your forms. If not, then you can use the always available ``csrf_token()``
and ``csrf_hash()`` functions
::

    <input type="hidden" name="<?= csrf_token() ?>" value="<?= csrf_hash() ?>" />

Additionally, you can use the ``csrf_field()`` method to generate this
hidden input field for you::

    // Generates: <input type="hidden" name="{csrf_token}" value="{csrf_hash}" />
    <?= csrf_field() ?>

When sending a JSON request the CSRF token can also be passed as one of the parameters.
The next way to pass the CSRF token is a special Http header that's name is available by
``csrf_header()`` function.

Additionally, you can use the ``csrf_meta()`` method to generate this handy
meta tag for you::

    // Generates: <meta name="{csrf_header}" content="{csrf_hash}" />
    <?= csrf_meta() ?>

The order of checking the availability of the CSRF token is as follows:

1. ``$_POST`` array
2. Http header
3. ``php://input`` (JSON request) - bare in mind that this approach is the slowest one since we have to decode JSON and then encode it again

Tokens may be either regenerated on every submission (default) or
kept the same throughout the life of the CSRF cookie. The default
regeneration of tokens provides stricter security, but may result
in usability concerns as other tokens become invalid (back/forward
navigation, multiple tabs/windows, asynchronous actions, etc). You
may alter this behavior by editing the following config parameter value in
**app/Config/Security.php**::

    public $regenerate  = true;

When a request fails the CSRF validation check, it will redirect to the previous page by default,
setting an ``error`` flash message that you can display to the end user. This provides a nicer experience
than simply crashing. This can be turned off by editing the following config parameter value in
**app/Config/Security.php**::

    public $redirect = false;

Even when the redirect value is **true**, AJAX calls will not redirect, but will throw an error.

*********************
Other Helpful Methods
*********************

You will never need to use most of the methods in the Security class directly. The following are methods that
you might find helpful that are not related to the CSRF protection.

**sanitizeFilename()**

Tries to sanitize filenames in order to prevent directory traversal attempts and other security threats, which is
particularly useful for files that were supplied via user input. The first parameter is the path to sanitize.

If it is acceptable for the user input to include relative paths, e.g., file/in/some/approved/folder.txt, you can set
the second optional parameter, $relative_path to true.
::

    $path = $security->sanitizeFilename($request->getVar('filepath'));
