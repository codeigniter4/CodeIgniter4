BREAKING
********

Message Changes
***************

- Added ``Language.invalidMessageFormat`` error message.

Changes
*******

- **Database Migrations:** The ``-g`` option for the ``spark migrate:rollback``
  command was removed. It did not work from the beginning. Also, the rollback
  command returns the database(s) state to a specified batch number and cannot
  specify only a specific database group.
- **Security:** The presence of the CSRF token is now also checked in the raw body (not JSON format) for PUT, PATCH, and DELETE type of requests.

Deprecations
************

- **Filters:** The Auto-Discovery for Filters and ``Filters::discoverFilters()``
  is deprecated. Use :ref:`registrars` instead. See :ref:`modules-filters` for
  details.
- **CLI:** The public property ``CLI::$readline_support`` and ``CLI::$wait_msg``
  are deprecated. These methods will be protected.

Bugs Fixed
**********

- **CodeIgniter:** Fixed a bug that returned "200 OK" response status code when
  Page Not Found.
- **Spark:** Fixed a bug that caused spark to not display exceptions in the
  production mode or to display backtrace in json when an exception occurred.

See the repo's
`CHANGELOG.md <https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md>`_
for a complete list of bugs fixed.
