BREAKING
********

- Because ``FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING`` is deprecated since PHP 8.1, ``get_cookie()`` that uses it when ``$xssClean`` is true changed the output. Now it uses ``FILTER_SANITIZE_FULL_SPECIAL_CHARS``. Note that using XSS filtering is a bad practice. It does not prevent XSS attacks perfectly. Using ``esc()`` with the correct ``$context`` in the views is recommended.
