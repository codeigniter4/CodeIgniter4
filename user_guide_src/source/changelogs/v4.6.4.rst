Bugs Fixed
**********

- **Database:** Fixed a bug in ``Database::connect()`` which was causing to store non-shared connection instances in shared cache.
- **Database:** Fixed a bug in ``Connection::getFieldData()`` for ``SQLSRV`` and ``OCI8`` where extra characters were returned in column default values (specific to those handlers), instead of following the convention used by other drivers.
- **Forge:** Fixed a bug in ``Postgre`` and ``SQLSRV`` where changing a column's default value using ``Forge::modifyColumn()`` method produced incorrect SQL syntax.

See the repo's
`CHANGELOG.md <https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md>`_
for a complete list of bugs fixed.
