**********
Highlights
**********

- Update minimal PHP requirement to ``8.2``.

********
BREAKING
********

Behavior Changes
================

Validation Rules
----------------

Placeholders in the ``regex_match`` validation rule must now use double curly braces.
If you previously used single braces like ``regex_match[/^{placeholder}$/]``, you must
update it to use double braces: ``regex_match[/^{{placeholder}}$/]``.

This change was introduced to avoid ambiguity with regular expression syntax,
where single curly braces (e.g., ``{1,3}``) are used for quantifiers.

Interface Changes
=================

- **Images:** The ``ImageHandlerInterface`` now includes a new method: ``clearMetadata()``. If you've implemented your own handler from scratch, you will need to provide an implementation for this method to ensure compatibility.

Method Signature Changes
========================

Removed Deprecated Items
========================

- **Text Helper:** The deprecated types in ``random_string()`` function: ``basic``, ``md5``, and ``sha1`` has been removed.

- **CURLRequest:** Added ``shareConnection`` config item to change default share connection.
- **CURLRequest:** Added ``dns_cache_timeout`` option to change default DNS cache timeout.
- **CURLRequest:** Added ``fresh_connect`` options to enable/disabled request fresh connection.
- **Email:** Added support for choosing the SMTP authorization method. You can change it via ``Config\Email::$SMTPAuthMethod`` option.
- **Image:** The ``ImageMagickHandler`` has been rewritten to rely solely on the PHP ``imagick`` extension.
- **Image:** Added ``ImageMagickHandler::clearMetadata()`` method to remove image metadata for privacy protection.
- **Time:** added methods ``Time::addCalendarMonths()`` and ``Time::subCalendarMonths()``
