Method Signature Changes
========================

- **Time:** For PHP 8.4 compatibility only, the first parameter type of the
  ``createFromTimestamp()`` method has been changed from ``int`` to ``int|float``,
  and the return type ``static`` has been added. But **note that the**
  ``createFromTimestamp()`` **method still cannot handle a float value, and the
  behavior is not yet changed**. That is, the behavior is not the exactly same as
  PHP 8.4's ``DateTimeImmutable::createFromTimestamp()`` method.
