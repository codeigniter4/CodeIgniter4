Validation changes
==================

- The previous version of the Validation can't handle an array item.
  Because of the bug fix, the validation results may be different,
  or raise a ``TypeError``.
  But the previous version's results are probably incorrect.
- The Validation separated the validation process of multiple field
  like ``contacts.*.name`` and single field.
  When a single field has an array data, the previous version validates each element of the array.
  The validation rule gets an element of the array as the parameter.
  On the other hand, the current version passes the array to the validation rule as a whole.

Enhancements
************

- Database pane on debug toolbar now displays location where Query was called from. Also displays full backtrace.
