Bugs Fixed
**********

- **Database:** Fixed a bug where ``Builder::affectedRows()`` threw an error when the previous query call failed in ``Postgre`` and ``SQLSRV`` drivers.
- **Security:** Fixed a bug where the CSRF token validation could fail on malformed input, causing a generic HTTP 500 status code instead of handling the input gracefully.

See the repo's
`CHANGELOG.md <https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md>`_
for a complete list of bugs fixed.
