BREAKING
********

Behavior Changes
================

.. _exceptions-when-database-errors-occur:

Exceptions when Database Errors Occur
-------------------------------------

- The exceptions thrown by the database connection classes have been changed to ``CodeIgniter\Database\Exceptions\DatabaseException``. Previously, different database drivers threw different exception classes, but these have been unified into ``DatabaseException``.
- The exceptions thrown by the ``execute()`` method of Prepared Queries have been changed to ``DatabaseException``. Previously, different database drivers might throw different exception classes or did not throw exceptions, but these have been unified into ``DatabaseException``.

HTTP Status Code and Exit Code when Exception Occurs
----------------------------------------------------

Previously, CodeIgniter's Exception Handler used the *Exception code* as the *HTTP status code* in some cases, and calculated the *Exit code* based on the Exception code. However there should be no logical connection with Exception code and HTTP Status Code or Exit code.

- Now the Exception Handler sets HTTP status code to ``500`` and set Exit code to the constant ``EXIT_ERROR`` (= ``1``) by default.
- You can change HTTP status code or Exit code to implement ``HTTPExceptionInterface`` or ``HasExitCodeInterface`` in your Exception class. See :ref:`error-specify-http-status-code` and :ref:`error-specify-exit-code`.

For example, the Exit code has been changed like the following:

- If an uncaught ``ConfigException`` occurs, the Exit code is ``EXIT_CONFIG`` (= ``3``) instead of ``12``.
- If an uncaught ``CastException`` occurs, the Exit code is ``EXIT_CONFIG`` (= ``3``) instead of ``9``.
- If an uncaught ``DatabaseException`` occurs, the Exit code is ``EXIT_DATABASE`` (= ``8``) instead of ``17``.

Others
------

- The ``spark`` file has been changed due to a change in the processing of Spark commands.
- ``InvalidArgumentException`` that is a kind of ``LogicException`` in ``BaseBuilder::_whereIn()`` is not suppressed by the configuration. Previously if ``CI_DEBUG`` was false, the exception was suppressed.
- ``RouteCollection::resetRoutes()`` resets Auto-Discovery of Routes. Previously once discovered, RouteCollection never discover Routes files again even if ``RouteCollection::resetRoutes()`` is called.

Enhancements
************

- Added the ``StreamFilterTrait`` to make it easier to work with capturing data from STDOUT and STDERR streams. See :ref:`testing-cli-output`.
- Added the ``PhpStreamWrapper`` to make it easier to work with setting data to ``php://stdin``. See :ref:`testing-cli-input`.
- Added before and after events to ``BaseModel::insertBatch()`` and ``BaseModel::updateBatch()`` methods. See :ref:`model-events-callbacks`.
- Added ``Model::allowEmptyInserts()`` method to insert empty data. See :ref:`Using CodeIgniter's Model <model-allow-empty-inserts>`
- Added ``$routes->useSupportedLocalesOnly(true)`` so that the Router returns 404 Not Found if the locale in the URL is not supported in ``Config\App::$supportedLocales``. See :ref:`Localization <localization-in-routes>`
- Added methods ``replace()``, ``addLineAfter()`` and ``addLineBefore()`` to modify files in Publisher. See :ref:`Publisher <publisher-modifying-files>` for details.
- The call handler for Spark commands from the ``CodeIgniter\CodeIgniter`` class has been extracted. This will reduce the cost of console calls.
- SQLite ``BaseConnection::getIndexData()`` now can return pseudo index named ``PRIMARY`` for `AUTOINCREMENT` column, and each returned index data has ``type`` property.
- Added ``spark filter:check`` command to check the filters for a route. See :ref:`Controller Filters <spark-filter-check>` for the details.
- Now **Encryption** can decrypt data encrypted with CI3's Encryption. See :ref:`encryption-compatible-with-ci3`.
- Added method ``Timer::record()`` to measure performance in a callable. Also enhanced common function ``timer()`` to accept optional callable.
- Now ``spark routes`` command shows route names. See :ref:`URI Routing <routing-spark-routes>`.
- Added new :ref:`entities-property-casting` class ``IntBoolCast`` for Entity.

Changes
*******

- DBDebug
    - To be consistent in behavior regardless of environments, ``Config\Database::$default['DBDebug']`` and ``Config\Database::$tests['DBDebug']`` has been changed to ``true`` by default. With these settings, an exception is always thrown when a database error occurs.
    - Now ``DatabaseException`` thrown in ``BaseBuilder`` is thrown if ``$DBDebug`` is true. Previously, it is thrown if ``CI_DEBUG`` is true.
    - The default value of ``BaseConnection::$DBDebug`` has been changed to ``true``.
    - With these changes, ``DBDebug`` now means whether or not to throw an exception when an error occurs. Although unrelated to debugging, the name has not been changed.
- Changed the processing of Spark commands:
    - The ``CodeIgniter\CodeIgniter`` no longer handles Spark commands.
    - The ``CodeIgniter::isSparked()`` method has been removed.
    - The ``CodeIgniter\CLI\CommandRunner`` class has been removed due to a change in Spark commands processing.
    - The system route configuration file ``system/Config/Routes.php`` has been removed.
    - The route configuration file ``app/Config/Routes.php`` has been changed. Removed include of system routes configuration file.
- All atomic type properties in ``Config`` classes have been typed.
