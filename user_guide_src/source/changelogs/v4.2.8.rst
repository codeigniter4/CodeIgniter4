Bugs Fixed
**********

- Fixed a bug when the ``CodeIgniter\HTTP\IncomingRequest::getPostGet()`` and ``CodeIgniter\HTTP\IncomingRequest::getGetPost()`` methods didn't return values from the other stream when ``index`` was set to ``null``.
- Fixed a bug when ``binds`` weren't cleaned properly when calling ``CodeIgniter\Database\Postgre::replace()`` multiple times in the context.
- Fixed a bug when the ``CodeIgniter\Database\SQLSRV\PreparedQuery::_getResult()`` was returning the bool value instead of the resource.
- Fixed a bug in the error handler where in cases the callback cannot process the error level it does not pass the error to PHP's standard error handler.
