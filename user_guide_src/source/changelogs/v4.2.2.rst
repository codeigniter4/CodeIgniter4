BREAKING
********

- Now ``Services::request()`` returns ``IncomingRequest`` or ``CLIRequest``.
- The method signature of ``CodeIgniter\Debug\Exceptions::__construct()`` has been changed. The ``IncomingRequest`` typehint on the ``$request`` parameter was removed. Extending classes should likewise remove the parameter so as not to break LSP.
- The method signature of ``BaseBuilder.php::insert()`` and ``BaseBuilder.php::update()`` have been changed. The ``?array`` typehint on the ``$set`` parameter was removed.

Enhancements
************

none.

Changes
*******

- Fixed: ``BaseBuilder::increment()`` and ``BaseBuilder::decrement()`` do not reset the ``BaseBuilder`` state after a query.
- Now ``CLIRequest::isCLI()`` always returns true.
- Now ``IncommingRequest::isCLI()`` always returns false.

Deprecations
************

- The parameters of ``Services::request()`` are deprecated.
