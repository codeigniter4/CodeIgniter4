BREAKING
********

Behavior Changes
================

- Guessing the file extension from the MIME type has been changed if the proposed extension is not valid. Previously, the guessing will early terminate and return ``null``. Now, if a proposed extension is given and is invalid, the MIME guessing will continue checking using the mapping of extension to MIME types.
- If there is a cookie with a prefixed name and a cookie with the same name without a prefix, the previous ``get_cookie()`` had the tricky behavior of returning the cookie without the prefix. Now the behavior has been fixed as a bug, and has been changed. See :ref:`Upgrading <upgrade-421-get_cookie>` for details.
