BREAKING
********

Behavior Changes
================

- Guessing the file extension from the MIME type has been changed if the proposed extension is not valid. Previously, the guessing will early terminate and return ``null``. Now, if a proposed extension is given and is invalid, the MIME guessing will continue checking using the mapping of extension to MIME types.
