Bugs Fixed
**********

- **Controller Filters:** In previous versions, ``['except' => []]`` or ``['except' => '']``
  meant "except all". The bug has been fixed, and now

    - ``['except' => []]`` means to exclude nothing.
    - ``['except' => '']`` means to exclude the baseURL only.

See the repo's
`CHANGELOG.md <https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md>`_
for a complete list of bugs fixed.
