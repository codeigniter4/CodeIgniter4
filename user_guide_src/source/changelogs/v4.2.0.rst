BREAKING
********

- The method signature of ``Validation::setRule()`` has been changed. The ``string`` typehint on the ``$rules`` parameter was removed. Extending classes should likewise remove the parameter so as not to break LSP.
- The ``CodeIgniter\CodeIgniter`` class has a new property ``$context`` and it must have the correct context at runtime. So the following files have been changed:
    - ``public/index.php``
    - ``spark``
- The method signature of ``CodeIgniter\CLI\CommandRunner::_remap()`` has been changed to fix a bug.
- The ``CodeIgniter\Autoloader\Autoloader::initialize()`` has changed the behavior to fix a bug. It used to use Composer classmap only when ``$modules->discoverInComposer`` is true. Now it always uses the Composer classmap if Composer is available.

Enhancements
************

- Content Security Policy (CSP) enhancements
    - Added the configs ``$scriptNonceTag`` and ``$styleNonceTag`` in  ``Config\ContentSecurityPolicy`` to customize the CSP placeholders (``{csp-script-nonce}`` and ``{csp-style-nonce}``)
    - Added the config ``$autoNonce`` in ``Config\ContentSecurityPolicy`` to disable the CSP placeholder replacement
    - Added the functions ``csp_script_nonce()`` and ``csp_style_nonce()`` to get nonce attributes
    - See :ref:`content-security-policy` for details.
- New :doc:`../outgoing/view_decorators` allow modifying the generated HTML prior to caching.
- Added Subqueries in the FROM section. See :ref:`query-builder-from-subquery`.
- Added Subqueries in the SELECT section. See :ref:`query-builder-select`.
- Added Validation Strict Rules. See :ref:`validation-traditional-and-strict-rules`.
- Added new OCI8 driver for database.
    - It can access Oracle Database and supports SQL and PL/SQL statements.
- The ``spark routes`` command now shows closure routes, auto routes, and filters. See :ref:`URI Routing <spark-routes>`.
- Exception information logged through ``log_message()`` has now improved. It now includes the file and line where the exception originated. It also does not truncate the message anymore.
    - The log format has also changed. If users are depending on the log format in their apps, the new log format is "<1-based count> <cleaned filepath>(<line>): <class><function><args>"
- Added support for webp files to **app/Config/Mimes.php**.
- Added 4th parameter ``$includeDir`` to ``get_filenames()``. See :php:func:`get_filenames`.

Changes
*******

- Update minimal PHP requirement to 7.4.
- The current version of Content Security Policy (CSP) outputs one nonce for script and one for style tags. The previous version outputted one nonce for each tag.
- The process of sending cookies has been moved to the ``Response`` class. Now the ``Session`` class doesn't send cookies, set them to the Response.
- Validation. Changed generation of errors when using fields with a wildcard (*). Now the error key contains the full path. See :ref:`validation-getting-all-errors`.
- ``Validation::getError()`` when using a wildcard will return all found errors matching the mask as a string.
- To make the default configuration more secure, auto-routing has been changed to disabled by default.

Deprecations
************

- ``CodeIgniter\Database\SQLSRV\Connection::getError()`` is deprecated. Use ``CodeIgniter\Database\SQLSRV\Connection::error()`` instead.
- ``CodeIgniter\Debug\Exceptions::cleanPath()`` and ``CodeIgniter\Debug\Toolbar\Collectors\BaseCollector::cleanPath()`` are deprecated. Use the ``clean_path()`` function instead.
- ``CodeIgniter\Log\Logger::cleanFilenames()`` and ``CodeIgniter\Test\TestLogger::cleanup()`` are both deprecated. Use the ``clean_path()`` function instead.
