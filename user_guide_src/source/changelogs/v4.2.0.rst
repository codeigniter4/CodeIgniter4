BREAKING
********

- The method signature of ``Validation::setRule()`` has been changed. The ``string`` typehint on the ``$rules`` parameter was removed. Extending classes should likewise remove the parameter so as not to break LSP.
- The ``CodeIgniter\CodeIgniter`` class has a new property ``$context`` and it must have the correct context at runtime. So the following files have been changed:
    - ``public/index.php``
    - ``spark``
- The method signature of ``CodeIgniter\CLI\CommandRunner::_remap()`` has been changed to fix a bug.
- The ``CodeIgniter\Autoloader\Autoloader::initialize()`` has changed the behavior to fix a bug. It used to use Composer classmap only when ``$modules->discoverInComposer`` is true. Now it always uses the Composer classmap if Composer is available.
- The color code output by :ref:`CLI::color() <cli-library-color>` has been changed to fix a bug.
- To prevent unexpected access from the web browser, if a controller is added to a cli route (``$routes->cli()``), all methods of that controller are no longer accessible via auto-routing.
- There is a possible backward compatibility break for those users extending the History Collector and they should probably update ``History::setFiles()`` method.

Enhancements
************

New Improved Auto Routing
=========================

Added an optional new more secure auto router. These are the changes from the legacy auto-routing:

- A controller method needs HTTP verb prefix like ``getIndex()``, ``postCreate()``.
    - Developers always know the HTTP method, so requests by an unexpected HTTP method does not pass.
- The Default Controller (``Home`` by default) and the Default Method (``index`` by default) must be omitted in the URI.
    - It restricts one-to-one correspondence between controller methods and URIs.
    - E.g. by default, you can access ``/``, but ``/home`` and ``/home/index`` will be 404.
- It checks method parameter count.
    - If there are more parameters in the URI than the method parameters, it results in 404.
- It does not support ``_remap()`` method.
    - It restricts one-to-one correspondence between controller methods and URIs.
- Can't access controllers in Defined Routes.
    - It completely separates controllers accessible via **Auto Routes** from those accessible via **Defined Routes**.

See :ref:`auto-routing-improved` for the details.

Others
======

- Content Security Policy (CSP) enhancements
    - Added the configs ``$scriptNonceTag`` and ``$styleNonceTag`` in  ``Config\ContentSecurityPolicy`` to customize the CSP placeholders (``{csp-script-nonce}`` and ``{csp-style-nonce}``)
    - Added the config ``$autoNonce`` in ``Config\ContentSecurityPolicy`` to disable the CSP placeholder replacement
    - Added the functions ``csp_script_nonce()`` and ``csp_style_nonce()`` to get nonce attributes
    - See :ref:`content-security-policy` for details.
- New :doc:`../outgoing/view_decorators` allow modifying the generated HTML prior to caching.
- Added Subqueries in the FROM section. See :ref:`query-builder-from-subquery`.
- Added Subqueries in the SELECT section. See :ref:`query-builder-select`.
- Added Validation Strict Rules. See :ref:`validation-traditional-and-strict-rules`.
- Added new OCI8 driver for database.
    - It can access Oracle Database and supports SQL and PL/SQL statements.
- The ``spark routes`` command now shows closure routes, auto routes, and filters. See :ref:`URI Routing <spark-routes>`.
- Exception information logged through ``log_message()`` has now improved. It now includes the file and line where the exception originated. It also does not truncate the message anymore.
    - The log format has also changed. If users are depending on the log format in their apps, the new log format is "<1-based count> <cleaned filepath>(<line>): <class><function><args>"
- Added support for webp files to **app/Config/Mimes.php**.
- Added 4th parameter ``$includeDir`` to ``get_filenames()``. See :php:func:`get_filenames`.
- HTML helper ``script_tag()`` now uses ``null`` values to write boolean attributes in minimized form: ``<script src="..." defer />``. See the sample code for :php:func:`script_tag`.
- RouteCollection::addRedirect() can now use placeholders.
- QueryBuilder raw SQL string support
    - Added the class ``CodeIgniter\Database\RawSql`` which expresses raw SQL strings.
    - :ref:`select() <query-builder-select-rawsql>`, :ref:`where() <query-builder-where-rawsql>`, :ref:`like() <query-builder-like-rawsql>` accept the ``CodeIgniter\Database\RawSql`` instance.
- Debugbar enhancements
    - Debug toolbar is now using ``microtime()`` instead of ``time()``.
- Added new Command for CLI.
  - ``db:table`` - You can now see the names of all the tables in the database you are currently connected, field names or other metadata, like the column type, max length and ... each table, and the information in that table in the terminal.
    - ``db:table --show``
    - ``db:table my_table``
    - ``db:table my_table --metadata``
    - ``db:table my_table --limit-row 50 --limit-column-length 20 --desc``

Changes
*******

- Update minimal PHP requirement to 7.4.
- The current version of Content Security Policy (CSP) outputs one nonce for script and one for style tags. The previous version outputted one nonce for each tag.
- The process of sending cookies has been moved to the ``Response`` class. Now the ``Session`` class doesn't send cookies, set them to the Response.
- Validation. Changed generation of errors when using fields with a wildcard (*). Now the error key contains the full path. See :ref:`validation-getting-all-errors`.
- ``Validation::getError()`` when using a wildcard will return all found errors matching the mask as a string.
- To make the default configuration more secure, auto-routing has been changed to disabled by default.

Deprecations
************

- ``CodeIgniter\Database\SQLSRV\Connection::getError()`` is deprecated. Use ``CodeIgniter\Database\SQLSRV\Connection::error()`` instead.
- ``CodeIgniter\Debug\Exceptions::cleanPath()`` and ``CodeIgniter\Debug\Toolbar\Collectors\BaseCollector::cleanPath()`` are deprecated. Use the ``clean_path()`` function instead.
- ``CodeIgniter\Log\Logger::cleanFilenames()`` and ``CodeIgniter\Test\TestLogger::cleanup()`` are both deprecated. Use the ``clean_path()`` function instead.
- ``CodeIgniter\Router\Router::setDefaultController()`` is deprecated.
- The constant ``SPARKED`` in **spark** is deprecated. Use the ``$context`` property in ``CodeIgniter\CodeIgniter`` instead.
- ``CodeIgniter\Autoloader\Autoloader::discoverComposerNamespaces()`` is deprecated, and no longer used.
