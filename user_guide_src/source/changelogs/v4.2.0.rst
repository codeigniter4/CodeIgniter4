BREAKING
********

- The method signature of ``Validation::setRule()`` has been changed. The ``string`` typehint on the ``$rules`` parameter was removed. Extending classes should likewise remove the parameter so as not to break LSP.

************

- Content Security Policy (CSP) enhancements
    - Added the configs ``$scriptNonceTag`` and ``$styleNonceTag`` in  ``Config\ContentSecurityPolicy`` to customize the CSP placeholders (``{csp-script-nonce}`` and ``{csp-style-nonce}``)
    - Added the config ``$autoNonce`` in ``Config\ContentSecurityPolicy`` to disable the CSP placeholder replacement
    - Added the functions ``csp_script_nonce()`` and ``csp_style_nonce()`` to get nonce attributes
    - See :ref:`content-security-policy` for details.
- New View Decorators allow modifying the generated HTML prior to caching.
- Added Subqueries in the FROM section. See :ref:`query-builder-from-subquery`.
