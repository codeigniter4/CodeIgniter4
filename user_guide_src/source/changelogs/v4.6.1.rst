Bugs Fixed
**********

- **CURLRequest:** Fixed an issue where multiple header sections appeared in the CURL response body during multiple redirects from the target server.
- **Cors:** Fixed a bug in the Cors filter that caused the appropriate headers to not be added when another filter returned a response object in the ``before`` filter.
- **Database:** Fixed a bug in ``Postgre`` and ``SQLite3`` handlers where composite unique keys were not fully taken into account for ``upsert`` type of queries.
- **Database:** Fixed a bug in the ``OCI8`` and ``SQLSRV`` drivers where ``getVersion()`` returned an empty string when the database connection was not yet established.

See the repo's
`CHANGELOG.md <https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md>`_
for a complete list of bugs fixed.
