Bugs Fixed
**********

- **CURLRequest:** Fixed an issue where multiple header sections appeared in the CURL response body during multiple redirects from the target server.
- **Cors:** Fixed a bug in the Cors filter that caused the appropriate headers to not be added when another filter returned a response object. From now on all CORS headers are added in the ``before`` filter and the ``after`` filter is no longer used.

See the repo's
`CHANGELOG.md <https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md>`_
for a complete list of bugs fixed.
