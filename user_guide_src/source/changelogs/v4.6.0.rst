BREAKING
********

Behavior Changes
================

.. _v460-behavior-changes-exceptions:

Exceptions
----------

The exception class has been redesigned. See :ref:`exception-design` for details.
The following breaking changes have been made accordingly:

- ``Validation::setRule()`` now throws ``CodeIgniter\Exceptions\InvalidArgumentException``
  instead of ``TypeError``.

- ``CriticalError`` now extends ``CodeIgniter\Exceptions\RuntimeException``
  instead of ``Error``.
- ``DatabaseException`` now extends ``CodeIgniter\Exceptions\RuntimeException``
  instead of ``Error``.
- ``ConfigException`` now extends ``CodeIgniter\Exceptions\RuntimeException``
  instead of ``CodeIgniter\Exceptions\CriticalError``.
- ``TestException`` now extends ``CodeIgniter\Exceptions\LogicException``
  instead of ``CodeIgniter\Exceptions\CriticalError``.

Filters Changes
---------------

The ``Filters`` class has been changed to allow multiple runs of the same filter
with different arguments in before or after. See
:ref:`Upgrading Guide <upgrade-460-filters-changes>` for details.

Registrars
----------

Added check to prevent Auto-Discovery of Registrars from running twice. If it is
executed twice, an exception will be thrown. See
:ref:`upgrade-460-registrars-with-dirty-hack`.

Time::createFromTimestamp()
---------------------------

``Time::createFromTimestamp()`` handles timezones differently. If ``$timezone``
is not explicitly passed then the instance has timezone set to UTC unlike earlier
where the currently set default timezone was used.
See :ref:`Upgrading Guide <upgrade-460-time-create-from-timestamp>` for details.

Time with Microseconds
----------------------

Fixed bugs that some methods in ``Time`` to lose microseconds have been fixed.
See :ref:`Upgrading Guide <upgrade-460-time-keeps-microseconds>` for details.

Time::setTimestamp()
--------------------

``Time::setTimestamp()`` behavior has been fixed.
See :ref:`Upgrading Guide <upgrade-460-time-set-timestamp>` for details.

Error Reporting to Non-HTML Requests
------------------------------------

In previous versions, when a request does not accept HTML, CodeIgniter showed
error details only in the ``development`` and ``testing`` environments.

But because it is not possible to display error details when using a custom
environment, this behavior has been fixed so that error details are displayed if
``display_errors`` in PHP ini setting is enabled.

With this fix, the error details are now displayed under the same conditions for
both HTML requests and non-HTML requests.

Session ID (SID)
----------------

Now ``Session`` library forces to use the PHP default 32 character SIDs, with 4
bits of entropy per character.
See :ref:`Upgrading Guide <upgrade-460-sid-change>` for details.

.. _v460-interface-changes:

Interface Changes
=================

.. note:: As long as you have not extended the relevant CodeIgniter core classes
    or implemented these interfaces, all these changes are backward compatible
    and require no intervention.

- **Router:** The following methods have been added in ``RouteCollectionInterface``:

    - ``getDefaultNamespace()``
    - ``getRoutesOptions()``
    - ``setHTTPVerb()``
    - ``isFiltered()``
    - ``getFiltersForRoute()``

.. _v460-method-signature-changes:

Method Signature Changes
========================

- **Router:** The constructor of the ``DefinedRouteCollector`` has been
  changed. The ``RouteCollection`` typehint has been changed to ``RouteCollectionInterface``.
- **View:** The return type of the ``renderSection()`` method has been
  changed to ``string``, and now the method does not call ``echo``.
- **Time:** The first parameter type of the ``createFromTimestamp()`` has been
  changed from ``int`` to ``int|float``, and the return type ``static`` has been
  added.

Removed Type Definitions
------------------------

- **Database:**
    - The type ``string`` of the first parameter in
      ``BaseConnection::escapeIdentifier()`` has been removed.
    - The type ``string`` of the first parameter in
      ``BaseConnection::getFieldNames()`` and ``SQLite3\Connection::getFieldNames()``
      have been removed.
    - The type ``string`` of the first parameter in
      ``BaseConnection::_listColumns()`` and ``MySQLi\Connection::_listColumns()``
      and ``OCI8\Connection::_listColumns()``
      and ``Postgre\Connection::_listColumns()``
      and ``SQLSRV\Connection::_listColumns()``
      and ``SQLite3\Connection::_listColumns()`` have been removed.

.. _v460-removed-deprecated-items:

Removed Deprecated Items
========================

- **API:** The deprecated ``failValidationError()`` method in ``CodeIgniter\API\ResponseTrait``
  has been removed. Use ``failValidationErrors()`` instead.
- **HTTP:** The deprecated ``getReason()`` method in ``CodeIgniter\HTTP\Response``
  and ``ResponseInterface`` has been removed. Use ``getReasonPhrase()`` instead.

  ``CodeIgniter\Test\TestLogger::cleanup()`` have been removed. Use the
  ``clean_path()`` function instead.

************
Enhancements

Publisher
=========

- ``Publisher::discover()`` now accepts a second parameter (``namespace``) specifying the namespace in which publishers should be searched. See :ref:`discovery-in-a-specific-namespace` for the details.

Exceptions

The exception class has been redesigned. See :ref:`exception-design` for details.
The following new Exception classes have been added accordingly:
