Behavior Changes
================

.. _v460-behavior-changes-exceptions:

Exceptions
----------

The exception class has been redesigned. See :ref:`exception-design` for details.
The following breaking changes have been made accordingly:

- ``Validation::setRule()`` now throws ``CodeIgniter\Exceptions\InvalidArgumentException``
  instead of ``TypeError``.

- ``CriticalError`` now extends ``CodeIgniter\Exceptions\RuntimeException``
  instead of ``Error``.
- ``DatabaseException`` now extends ``CodeIgniter\Exceptions\RuntimeException``
  instead of ``Error``.
- ``ConfigException`` now extends ``CodeIgniter\Exceptions\RuntimeException``
  instead of ``CodeIgniter\Exceptions\CriticalError``.
- ``TestException`` now extends ``CodeIgniter\Exceptions\LogicException``
  instead of ``CodeIgniter\Exceptions\CriticalError``.

Filters Changes
---------------

The ``Filters`` class has been changed to allow multiple runs of the same filter
with different arguments in before or after. See
:ref:`Upgrading Guide <upgrade-460-filters-changes>` for details.

Registrars
----------

Added check to prevent Auto-Discovery of Registrars from running twice. If it is
executed twice, an exception will be thrown. See
:ref:`upgrade-460-registrars-with-dirty-hack`.

Time::createFromTimestamp()
---------------------------

``Time::createFromTimestamp()`` handles timezones differently. If ``$timezone``
is not explicitly passed then the instance has timezone set to UTC unlike earlier
where the currently set default timezone was used.
See :ref:`Upgrading Guide <upgrade-460-time-create-from-timestamp>` for details.

Time with Microseconds
----------------------

Fixed bugs that some methods in ``Time`` to lose microseconds have been fixed.
See :ref:`Upgrading Guide <upgrade-460-time-keeps-microseconds>` for details.

Time::setTimestamp()
--------------------

``Time::setTimestamp()`` behavior has been fixed.
See :ref:`Upgrading Guide <upgrade-460-time-set-timestamp>` for details.

Error Reporting to Non-HTML Requests
------------------------------------

In previous versions, when a request does not accept HTML, CodeIgniter showed
error details only in the ``development`` and ``testing`` environments.

But because it is not possible to display error details when using a custom
environment, this behavior has been fixed so that error details are displayed if
``display_errors`` in PHP ini setting is enabled.

With this fix, the error details are now displayed under the same conditions for
both HTML requests and non-HTML requests.

Session ID (SID)
----------------

Now ``Session`` library forces to use the PHP default 32 character SIDs, with 4
bits of entropy per character.
See :ref:`Upgrading Guide <upgrade-460-sid-change>` for details.

.. _v460-interface-changes:

Headers
-------

The headers set by the ``Response`` class replace those that can be set by the PHP
``header()`` function.

In previous versions, headers set by the ``Response`` class were added to existing
ones - giving no options to change them. That could lead to unexpected behavior when
the same headers were set with mutually exclusive directives.

For example, session will automatically set headers with the ``header()`` function:

.. code-block:: none

    Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
    Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate
    Pragma: no-cache

So if we set **Expires** header one more time we will end up with a duplicated header:

.. code-block:: php

    $response->removeHeader('Expires'); // has no effect
    return $response->setHeader('Expires', 'Sun, 17 Nov 2024 14:17:37 GMT');

Response headers:

.. code-block:: none

    Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
    // ...
    Expires: Sun, 17 Nov 2024 14:17:37 GMT

Now, we don't know which one will be picked by the browser or which header is the correct one.
With changes in this version our previous header will be overridden:

.. code-block:: none

    Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate
    Pragma: no-cache
    Expires: Sun, 17 Nov 2024 14:17:37 GMT

Interface Changes
=================

.. note:: As long as you have not extended the relevant CodeIgniter core classes
    or implemented these interfaces, all these changes are backward compatible
    and require no intervention.

- **Router:** The following methods have been added in ``RouteCollectionInterface``:

    - ``getDefaultNamespace()``
    - ``getRoutesOptions()``
    - ``setHTTPVerb()``
    - ``isFiltered()``
    - ``getFiltersForRoute()``

.. _v460-method-signature-changes:

Method Signature Changes
========================

- **Router:** The constructor of the ``DefinedRouteCollector`` has been
  changed. The ``RouteCollection`` typehint has been changed to ``RouteCollectionInterface``.
- **View:** The return type of the ``renderSection()`` method has been
  changed to ``string``, and now the method does not call ``echo``.
- **Time:** The first parameter type of the ``createFromTimestamp()`` has been
  changed from ``int`` to ``int|float``, and the return type ``static`` has been
  added.

Removed Type Definitions
------------------------

- **Database:**
    - The type ``string`` of the first parameter in
      ``BaseConnection::escapeIdentifier()`` has been removed.
    - The type ``string`` of the first parameter in
      ``BaseConnection::getFieldNames()`` and ``SQLite3\Connection::getFieldNames()``
      have been removed.
    - The type ``string`` of the first parameter in
      ``BaseConnection::_listColumns()`` and ``MySQLi\Connection::_listColumns()``
      and ``OCI8\Connection::_listColumns()``
      and ``Postgre\Connection::_listColumns()``
      and ``SQLSRV\Connection::_listColumns()``
      and ``SQLite3\Connection::_listColumns()`` have been removed.

.. _v460-removed-deprecated-items:

Removed Deprecated Items
========================

- **API:** The deprecated ``failValidationError()`` method in ``CodeIgniter\API\ResponseTrait``
  has been removed. Use ``failValidationErrors()`` instead.
- **HTTP:** The deprecated ``getReason()`` method in ``CodeIgniter\HTTP\Response``
  and ``ResponseInterface`` has been removed. Use ``getReasonPhrase()`` instead.
- **Logger:** The deprecated ``CodeIgniter\Log\Logger::cleanFilenames()`` and
  ``CodeIgniter\Test\TestLogger::cleanup()`` have been removed. Use the
  ``clean_path()`` function instead.

************
Enhancements
************

Publisher
=========

- ``Publisher::discover()`` now accepts a second parameter (``namespace``) specifying the namespace in which publishers should be searched. See :ref:`discovery-in-a-specific-namespace` for the details.

Exceptions
==========

The exception class has been redesigned. See :ref:`exception-design` for details.
The following new Exception classes have been added accordingly:

- ``CodeIgniter\Exceptions\LogicException``
- ``CodeIgniter\Exceptions\RuntimeException``
- ``CodeIgniter\Exceptions\BadFunctionCallException``
- ``CodeIgniter\Exceptions\BadMethodCallException``
- ``CodeIgniter\Exceptions\InvalidArgumentException``

The following new Exception interfaces have been added:

- ``CodeIgniter\Files\Exceptions\ExceptionInterface``
- ``CodeIgniter\HTTP\Exceptions\ExceptionInterface``
- ``CodeIgniter\Router\Exceptions\ExceptionInterface``

Displaying exceptions for non-HTML responses now rely on the PHP ``display_errors`` setting instead of hardcoded environments.

Commands
========

- The ``spark routes`` and ``spark filter:check`` commands now display filter
  arguments.
- The ``spark filter:check`` command now displays filter classnames.

Routing
=======

- Now you can specify multiple hostnames when restricting routes.

Testing
=======

Database
========

Query Builder
-------------

Forge
-----

Others
------

- Added a new configuration ``foundRows`` for MySQLi to use ``MYSQLI_CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS``.
- Added the ``BaseConnection::resetTransStatus()`` method to reset the transaction
  status. See :ref:`transactions-resetting-transaction-status` for details.
- SQLite3 has a new Config item ``synchronous`` to adjust how strict SQLite is at flushing
  to disk during transactions. Modifying this can be useful if we use journal mode set to ``WAL``.

Model

Libraries
=========

- **File:** Added ``getSizeByBinaryUnit()`` and ``getSizeByMetricUnit()`` to ``File`` class.
