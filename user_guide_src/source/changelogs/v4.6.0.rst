    or implemented these interfaces, all these changes are backward compatible
    and require no intervention.

    - ``getDefaultNamespace()``
    - ``getRoutesOptions()``
    - ``setHTTPVerb()``
    - ``isFiltered()``
    - ``getFiltersForRoute()``

- **Router:** The constructor of the ``DefinedRouteCollector`` has been
  changed. The ``RouteCollection`` typehint has been changed to ``RouteCollectionInterface``.
- **View:** The return type of the ``renderSection()`` method has been
  changed to ``string``, and now the method does not call ``echo``.

.. _v460-removed-deprecated-items:

Removed Deprecated Items
========================

- **API:** The deprecated ``failValidationError()`` method in ``CodeIgniter\API\ResponseTrait``
  has been removed. Use ``failValidationErrors()`` instead.
