    :depth: 2

Highlights
----------

- added $maxQueries setting to app/Config/Toolbar.php
- updated PHP dependency to 7.2
- new feature branches have been created for the email and queue modules, so they don't impact the release of 4.0.0
- dropped several language messages that were unused (eg Migrations.missingTable) and added some new (eg Migrations.invalidType)
- lots of bug fixes, especially for the database support
- provided filters (CSRF, Honeypot, DebugToolbar) have been moved from app/Filters/ to system/Filters/
- revisited the installation and tutorial sections of the user guide
- code coverage is at 77% ... getting ever closer to our target of 80% :)

We hope this will be the last alpha, and that the next pre-release will be our first beta ... fingers crossed!
