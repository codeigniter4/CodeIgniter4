Validation with Dot Array Syntax
================================

A validation rule with the wildcard ``*`` now validates only data in correct
dimensions as "dot array syntax".
See :ref:`Upgrading <upgrade-444-validation-with-dot-array-syntax>` for details.

Validation rules matches and differs
====================================

Bugs have been fixed in the case where ``matches`` and ``differs`` in the Strict
and Traditional rules validate data of non-string types.

Filesystem Helper
====================================

``get_filenames()`` now follows symlink folders, which it previously just returned
without following.
