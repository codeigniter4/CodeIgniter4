BREAKING
========

- Fixed `a bug <https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/issues/2913>`_ on CSRF protection. Now CSRF protection works on PUT/PATCH/DELETE requests when CSRF filter is applied. If you use such requests, you need to send CSRF token.
- In the previous version, if you didn't provide your own headers, ``CURLRequest`` would send the request-headers from the browser, due to a bug. As of this version, it does not send them.
- Fixed ``BaseBuilder::insertBatch()`` return value for ``testMode``. Now it returns SQL string array instead of a number of affected rows. This change was made because of maintaining compatibility between returning types for batch methods. Now the returned data type for ``BaseBuilder::insertBatch()`` is the same as the `updateBatch()` method.
- Major optimizations have been made to the way data is processed in ``BaseBuilder::insertBatch()`` and ``BaseBuilder::updateBatch()`` methods. This resulted in reduced memory usage and faster query processing. As a trade-off, the result generated by the ``$query->getOriginalQuery()`` method was changed. It no longer returns the query with the binded parameters, but the actual query that was run.

Enhancements
============

- Added Cache config for reserved characters
- The :ref:`addForeignKey()<adding-foreign-keys>` function of the ``Forge`` class can now define composite foreign keys in an array
- The ``dropKey`` function of the ``Forge`` class can remove key
- Now ``_`` can be used as separators in environment variable. See :ref:`env-var-namespace-separator`.
- Added Multiple filters for a route and Classname filter
- Reduced memory usage of ``insertBatch()`` and ``updateBatch()``
- Added :ref:`Session based CSRF Protection <csrf-protection-methods>`
- Added ``valid_url_strict`` rule for ``Validation``
- Debug Toolbar
    - Added formatted query string to timeline
    - Improved keyword highlighting and escaping of query strings

Changes
=======

- Always escape identifiers in the ``set``, ``setUpdateBatch``, and ``insertBatch`` functions in ``BaseBuilder``.
