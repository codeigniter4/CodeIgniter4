Build Your First Application
****************************

This project walks you through building a basic news application. You will begin by writing code that loads static pages. Next, you will create a news section that reads news items from a database. Finally, you'll add a form to create news items in the database. This gives you a good overview of how CodeIgniter works and how to use its main components.

Build a RESTful API
*******************

This guide helps you build a simple RESTful API using CodeIgniter 4. You will learn how to use auto-routing, set up controllers, and handle requests and responses in a RESTful manner. By the end of this guide, you will have a functional API that can perform CRUD operations on a resource. This introduces you to the basic concepts of a RESTful API and the tools that CodeIgniter provides to facilitate its development.
