Conclusion
==========

This guide provided an overview of using CodeIgniter4 to build a simple RESTful API for managing books and authors. You learned how to set up a CodeIgniter project, configure a database, create models, and implement API endpoints using controllers and auto-routing, along with the ``ResponseTrait`` for consistent API responses.

From here, you can expand your API by adding more resources, implementing authentication and authorization using `CodeIgniter Shield <https://shield.codeigniter.com/>`__, and exploring advanced features like :doc:`../../libraries/throttler`, :doc:`../../incoming/controller_attributes`, and :doc:`../../general/caching`. CodeIgniter's flexibility and powerful features make it an excellent choice for building robust APIs.
