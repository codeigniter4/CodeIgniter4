## What is CodeIgniter?
CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible, and secure. 
More information can be found at the [official site](http://codeigniter.com).

This repository holds the pre-alpha code for CodeIgniter 4 only. 
Version 4 is a complete rewrite to bring the quality and the code into a more modern version, 
while still keeping as many of the things intact that has made people love the framework over the years. 

**This is pre-release code and should not be used in production sites.**

More information about the plans for version 4 can be found in [the announcement](http://forum.codeigniter.com/thread-62615.html) on the forums.

## Repository Management
We use Github issues to track **BUGS** and to track approved **DEVELOPMENT** work packages.
We use our [forum](http://forum.codeigniter.com) to provide SUPPORT and to discuss
FEATURE REQUESTS.

If you raise an issue here that pertains to support or a feature request, it will
be closed! If you are not sure if you have found a bug, raise a thread on the forum first -
someone else may have encountered the same thing.

Before raising a new Github issue, please check that your bug hasn't already
been reported or fixed. 

We use pull requests (PRs) for CONTRIBUTIONS to the repository.
We are looking for contributions that address one of the reported bugs or
approved work packages.

Do not use a PR as a form of feature request.
Unsolicited contributions will only be considered if they fit nicely
into the framework roadmap.
Remember that some components that were part of CodeIgniter 3 are being moved
to optional packages, with their own repository.

## Contributing
We are not accepting contributions from the public until a stable enough base has been formed, 
and our plans fleshed out and things settle down a little bit. 
At that point, we will welcome your comments and help creating the best framework for our community.

Please read the *Contributing to CodeIgniter* section in the user guide

## Server Requirements
PHP version 7 or higher is required. 

## Running CodeIgniter Tests
Information on running CodeIgniter test suite can be found in the README.md file in the tests directory.
