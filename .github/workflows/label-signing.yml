            You must GPG-sign your work, certifying that you either wrote the work or otherwise have the right to pass it on to an open-source project. See Developer's Certificate of Origin. See [signing][1].

            **Note that all your commits must be signed.** If you have an unsigned commit, you can sign the previous commits by referring to [gpg-signing-old-commits][2].
